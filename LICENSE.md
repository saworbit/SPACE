-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notice

The Business Source License (this document, or the "License") is not an Open 
Source license. However, the Licensed Work will eventually be made available 
under an Open Source License, as stated in this License.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

License Grant

Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby grants 
you a non-exclusive, worldwide, non-transferable license to:

  1. Use, copy, modify, and prepare derivative works of the Licensed Work
  2. Reproduce and distribute copies of the Licensed Work
  3. Publicly perform and publicly display the Licensed Work

Provided that you do not:

  • Use the Licensed Work for production purposes beyond the Additional Use 
    Grant thresholds without obtaining a commercial license or active 
    contributor status
  • Use the Licensed Work to provide a Database Service, Storage Service, or 
    similar offering where the Licensed Work is provided to third parties as 
    a commercial service (unless covered by contributor exemption)
  • Remove or obscure any licensing, copyright, or other notices
  • Use the Licensor's trademarks without permission

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Contributor License Clarification

What qualifies as an "active contributor"?

Your organization qualifies for free commercial use if you maintain active 
contribution:

  • Minimum: 3+ merged pull requests in the past 12 months, OR
  • Substantial: 1+ major feature, architectural improvement, or significant 
    bug fix accepted in the past 12 months

What counts as a contribution?
  • Code improvements (features, bug fixes, performance)
  • Documentation enhancements
  • Test coverage additions
  • Security patches
  • Architecture proposals that are implemented

What does NOT count:
  • Typo fixes alone
  • Issue reports (without PRs)
  • Drive-by PRs without ongoing engagement

Verification:
  • Contributors are tracked via GitHub commit history
  • Organizations must register their contributor association at 
    shane@adaptive-storage.dev
  • Annual renewal based on continued activity

Important Note:
  Contributor exemption does NOT allow offering SPACE as a hosted service 
  to third parties. That always requires a separate commercial agreement.

Example:
  If Alice works for MegaCorp (500 employees, $50M revenue) and contributes 
  5 meaningful PRs in 2025, MegaCorp can use SPACE in production for free 
  through 2026, provided Alice (or other MegaCorp employees) continue 
  contributing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Termination

This License automatically terminates if you violate any of its terms. 
Contributor exemptions terminate if contribution activity ceases for more 
than 12 months.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
